# Journal

Journal gives you a new way to think about logging in your application. You can log everything to the Journal Client application, where you can filter your logs to only see the relevant loglines.

It has all the needed logging features, so you can use it as the primary logging library in your application.

This is the client application for the Journal iOS logging library: https://github.com/holloandris/Journal

# Usage

Download the desktop application from the Releases tab, and it's ready to use. Connect to it from your iOS application where Journal is included, and you will instantly see your logs coming through.
